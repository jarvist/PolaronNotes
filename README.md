# PolaronNotes
Notes on reading the Polaron literature

Mainly on re-deriving results in Schultz1959 ( https://doi.org/10.1103%2Fphysrev.116.526  - Slow Electrons in Polar Crystals: Self-Energy, Mass, and Mobility).

Please do send me any corrections / updates. 
This work is never intended to be published, just a useful note if anyone else is doing Polaron stuff!
